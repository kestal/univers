The dwarfs are a humano√Ød species living everywhere, mainly underground.
There are many different kinds of dwarfs, depending on where they live.

Compared to humans, they are smaller, bulkyer and stronger. It seems that they have really practical and analytic
ways of thinking, which makes them renown for their structuralist philosophy, their engineers and their architects.

They live in giant realms, that doesnt work with borders but with cultural similarities.
Every eight years dwarfs from all around the world elect a council of wise, that will direct them throughout
the following octennial. These wise don't have a full political power over all the realms, but are treated specially.

## life time

Dwarfs live longer than humans. Usually up to 220 years, but there are stories about dwarfs that lived more than 400 years.
At 40, dwarfs are considered as adults, and at 160 they are considered wise.
