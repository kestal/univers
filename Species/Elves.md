The elves are an almost feral humano√Ød species living mainly in naturally isolated places.

# Anatomy
From a distance, an elf could be mistaken for a human; they often share the sveltness of children or women.
The tint of their skin is dependent on their specific milieu, varying from a light brown-green to almost white.
Some males have been seen to have antlers, up to the size of an arm.

# Geographic Distribution
The elvish population is rather evenly distributed across all continents and lands.
They prefer hardly accessible places and seem to thrive when left alone.

# Society, magic and sickness
Elves have a relatively strong [magical](/Magic/Magic.md) footprint; they can easily enter the praeter without any source of power. In fact, they have such a natural strong bond with it that they become themselves sources of power.

Elves are influenced by the number and proximity of their pairs. The closer they are to each other, the stronger their bond with the praeter becomes, increasing their magical affinity. Unfortunately, this proximity also awakens their feral instinct and weakens their intellect, bringing the little culture and society they had into something more savage.

Elves also have a magical lust. As long as they stand in small group, some can resist it. Therefore some of them will stay in tribe while some will yield to their pulses and regroup more. When their feral instinct aweaks, they will start using their congeners as sources of power, even if they have to kill each others. This madness even push them to cannibalism, as they want to imbibe the power.

While few elves have no intellectual weakness nor any bond to the warp, a larger group is quite bound to the praeter and only have a small intellectual weakness. Therefore, the typical societal structure and the best balanced for elves is tribes of about 10 to 20 individuals. Those tribes are hunters gatherers, although some have shown early signs of cultivation and animal domestication.

There is however a non negligible quantity of elves living in larger groups than the dozen. Thenceforth, their feral instinct shows quickly  and they organize themselves like packs, each with a pack leader bringing them to work cooperatively in certain cases. Their lust and feral instinct aren't although so anarchical and cannibalism isn't a permanent behavior.
