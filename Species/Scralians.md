# The Scralians

## Morphology
Nyctalope species with big and orange eyes. These are very efficient at night but suffer a small photophobia. Their hearing and smell are both superiors to ours. Like us, they got four members composed of five fingers each.

The hind limbs are long, mostly because of the very elongated tarsus bones of the feets. The head and the body varies between 40 and 50 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice as big (foots included). They also got a 30 to 35 cm long tapered tail.

Their hands include five fingers (with nails) of elongated shape, with the third about the same size than the the arm (arm doesn't include the forearm). They got a fine, soft and velvety fur, generally whitish colored.

## Home and climate
They live either in temperate regions with vast forests and mountains or either in a continental cliate, arid and colder. Both regions have cold and snowy winters. Situated in the upper part of the artic circle, the daylight varies extremely between the seasons.

The typical house is build in the rock. It extends sometimes in tunnels which perforate the mountain and form vast networks. The nomads use tents in winter and return to the mountain villages during summer.

## Denominations and etymology
In the common language they are called the _White creepers_ or the _Night beasts_. However, some of the humans who trade with them call them more respectfully _Scralians_.

Scralian comes from the word _Skralan_ which belongs to their own language. This word is formed of _Skral_, meaning folk, and _Ann_, meaning the moon.
