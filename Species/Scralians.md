# The Scralians

## Morphology
Nyctalope species with big and orange eyes. These are very efficient at night but suffer a small photophobia. Their hearing and smell are both superiors to ours. Like us, they got four members composed of five fingers each.

The hind limbs are long, mostly because of the very elongated tarsus bones of the feets. The head and the body varies between 40 and 50 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice as big (foots included). They also got a 30 to 35 cm long tapered tail.

Their hands include five fingers (with nails) of elongated shape, with the third about the same size than the the arm (arm doesn't include the forearm). They got a fine, soft and velvety fur, generally whitish colored.

## Home and climate
They live either in temperate regions with vast forests and mountains or either in a continental cliate, arid and colder. Both regions have cold and snowy winters. Situated in the upper part of the artic circle, the daylight varies extremely between the seasons.

The typical house is build in the rock. It extends sometimes in tunnels which perforate the mountain and form vast networks. The nomads use tents in winter and return to the mountain villages during summer.

## Behavior and culture
Although they are omnivore, they mostly rely on meat due to the difficulty to farm. Their photophibia forces them to stay in the mountains during the long days of summer, where they expoit the mines and practice all kind of crafting.

They avail the long nights of winter to roam the great plains and hunt the game. They salt and dry most of it for the summer. Therefore salt is essential to their economy. Although they got some salt mines, they trade with men to get their sufficient quantity, selling them metals and products of manufacture.

Along their nyctalope condition, they naturally developed a moon calendar. They got their own money made of bronze and silver, although some of them share a common money with their human neighbors.

## Mathematics
They developed a quinary additive system. Symbols represent the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250 et 625. The four first symbols are unique, while the others follow a constructive scheme.

The 25, 125 and 625 symbols correspond to a 5 symbol mixed with either a 1, 2 or 3 symbol. The results are 5×5¹, 5×5² and 5×5³. With the same process, the 10, 50 and 250 symbols correspond to a 2 symbol mixed with either a 1, 2 or 3 symbol. The results are this time 2×5¹, 2×5² and 2×5³.

Here are some examples using the [...] to represent symbols: 6 = [5][1] , 8 = [2][10] , 16 = [10][5][1] , 28 = [25][3] , 1’749 = [625][625][125][1][625]. The rules are: when a lower symbol is added to the right, it's additioned, while when it's added to the left, it's substracted to the following superior. Note also that the symbol representing 3 is only used for its own number.

## Denominations and etymology
In the common language they are called the _White creepers_ or the _Night beasts_. However, some of the humans who trade with them call them more respectfully _Scralians_.

Scralian comes from the word _Skralan_ which belongs to their own language. This word is formed of _Skral_, meaning folk, and _Ann_, meaning the moon.
