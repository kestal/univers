# The Scralians
Scralians are more a human folk than a species on its own, but their anatomical differences change a bit their appearance and especially their lifestyle.

While some live among the "common" humans, the greater part lives in secluded communities.

## Anatomy
The Scralians are basically humans, with two differences though. First their skin and their hairs are entirely whites, while their eyes have an almost red iris. Secondly, they have a different vision: a bad perception of colors, a minor photophobia and a good visual acuity at night. 

## Home and climate
They live either in temperate regions with vast forests and mountains or either in a continental cliate, arid and colder. Both regions have cold and snowy winters. There, the daylight varies extremely between the seasons.

Their cities benefit the protection of the montains as they are built in the rock. These basically stay on the hillside, with sometimes some mining areas. The hunters and traders use tents in winter and return to the mountain villages during summer.

## Behavior and culture
Although they are omnivore, they mostly rely on meat due to the difficulty to farm. Their photophibia forces them to stay in the mountains and forests during the long days of summer, where they expoit the mines and practice all kind of crafting.

They avail the long nights of winter to roam the great plains and hunt the game. They salt and dry most of it to gather reserves for the summer. Therefore salt is essential for their economy. Although they got some salt mines, they trade with men to get their sufficient quantity, selling them metals and products of manufacture.

Along their nocturnal lifestyle, they naturally developed a lunar calendar. The lunar year is composed of 34 lunar month, each representing one god. The lunar month begins with the new moon. They use to share a common money with their human neighbors.

## Mathematics
They developed a quinary additive system. Symbols represent the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250 et 625. The four first symbols are unique, while the others follow a constructive scheme.

The 25, 125 and 625 symbols correspond to a 5 symbol mixed with either a 1, 2 or 3 symbol. The results are 5×5¹, 5×5² and 5×5³. With the same process, the 10, 50 and 250 symbols correspond to a 2 symbol mixed with either a 1, 2 or 3 symbol. The results are this time 2×5¹, 2×5² and 2×5³.

Here are some examples where bracketed ellipsis represent the symbols: 4 = [1][5], 6 = [5][1] , 8 = [2][10] , 16 = [10][5][1] , 28 = [25][3] , 1’749 = [625][625][125][1][625]. The rules are: when a lower symbol is added to the right, it's additioned, while when it's added to the left, it's substracted to the following superior. Note also that the symbol representing 3 is only used for its own number.

## Denominations and etymology
In the common language they are called the _White demons_ or the _Night walkers_. However, some of the humans who trade with them call them more respectfully _Scralians_.

Scralian comes from the word _Skralan_ which belongs to their own language. This word is formed of _Skral_, meaning folk, and _Ann_, meaning the moon.

## In the world
A huge and cold ocean surround their territories north and east. On their western borders, there is the Nendal's folk, often in conflict with them. On the south stand the Wind Tribe. This tribe is their historical trade partner, although we can see some tensions since the formation of the Fragmented Realm.
