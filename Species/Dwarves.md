The dwarves are a humanoid species living on [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md), mainly underground.


They are smaller and bulkier than humans.
They have a practical and analytic way of thinking, which makes them known for their philosophers, engineers and architects.
They are seen as friendly and outgoing.

Dwarves live in realms that don't work with physical borders but with cultural similarities.
Every eight years dwarves from all around the world elects the  [Council of the Wise](), that will direct them throughout the following octennial.

## Life Time

Dwarves live longer than humans.
Usually up to 220 years, but stories mention lifetime surpassing 400 years.
At 40, dwarfs are considered as adults, and at 160 they are considered wise. 

## Society

The dwarf society is somewhat difficult for humans to understand.
They have cultural realms, which means that two cities, even apart from thousands of kilometers, could be in one same realm, yet being surrounded by other cities from other realms.
Every realm is ruled by a leading party, the political systems vary from one to another, but monarchy is the most common form.

The [Wise Council](/Organization/Wise Council.md), elected every eight years, is there to have a bridge between each dwarf realm.
Its purpose is to give to the dwarves an overview of the general situation of the world, spiritually leading them.
They also have a really strong political power over the realms. 
Some mad dwarf kings have already been thrown down by the council. 
The council is elected by every single dwarf, and any old enough dwarf could be elected. 
When the new council is elected, each wise have to choose 8 person to accompany him.
They then go live together in a "cloister".
Practically, they play an important role on general dwarf politic ; If the whole nation has to make choices, it will turn to them.
They also help to keep harmony between the realms.
Technically, they have some kind of full power according to dwarf law.
They don't use it so much though, their main quest being the harmony and the progress of dwarf kind.

The dwarf society has doesn't really care for gender.
A man or a woman can be the ruler, or a wise, or anything. 
Dwarves normally don't open their cities for other species, but some do live in humans or others town.
They don't want to get involved in other folks politic, considering they have to much to do for themselves.

## Beliefs

Religion occupies a large but paradoxical part of the dwarves beliefs and philosophy.
In broad strokes, the dwarves believe in some sort of relatively distant pantheon of gods, who live in harmony in the Nirvana and generally want the good of the world, although they don't interfere with it often.
The dwarves believe, in an abstract sense, that they live by the god's will and that the current state of affair of the world, and its direction, is the right one.
They will often mention the gods, call for their benediction, or propose that some object or action is blessed, without necessarily believing that the gods really care for things so mundane.

In the same sense, the political organization in place in each realm is considered to be a religious one as much as a political one, and the [Wise Council]() is the top of their religious pyramid.
Dwarves believe that the [Wise Council]() is as close to the god's will as can be achieved; not in the sense that its members particularly hear what the gods want, but because if they are elected to such a highly influential position, it must be by the gods' will.

Thus, in everyday life, dwarves will often mention the gods, but not necessarily accord them much more thought than this almost linguistic habit.

## Geography

Dwarves live in cities and town, often underground, but sometimes not.
They favor the vicinity of active and inactive volcanoes.
Sometimes great underground roads connect different dwarf places, but other times they just have to go outside.
Dwarves normally have good communication systems between cities.


## Wisdom

The quality of being wise plays an important role in dwarves' thinking.
Often associated with age, being wise is one of the highest compliment a dwarf can receive.
Theologically, being wise means that the gods have gifted the individual with understanding of the world, and the knowing of the ideal direction for it.


## Food
Indoor culture of mushrooms makes a great part of dwarf food production and consumption.


## Relations with humans

Due to the relative stability and uniformity of dwarf culture, many of their constructs have been used by humans. 
Two important examples of those are justice and currency.

## Magic

Dwarves aren't magical being, but they practice magic, unconsciously, by their heavy and complex use of rituals.
