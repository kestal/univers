The dwarves are a humano√Ød species living everywhere, mainly underground.
There are many different kinds of dwarves, depending on where they live.

Compared to humans, they are smaller, bulkier and stronger. It seems that they have really practical and analytic
ways of thinking, which makes them reknown for their structuralist philosophy, their engineers and their architects.
They are seen as friendly and outgoing, some are real tricksters.

They live in giant realms, that don't work with borders but with cultural similarities.
Every eight years dwarves from all around the world elect a council of wise, that will direct them throughout
the following octennial.

## Life Time

Dwarves live longer than humans. Usually up to 220 years, but there are stories about dwarfs that lived more than 400 years.
At 40, dwarfs are considered as adults, and at 160 they are considered wise. 

## Society

The dwarf society is somewhat difficult for humans.
They have cultural realms, wich means that two cities, even apart from thousands of kilometers, could be in one same realm, yet being surrounded by other cities from other realms.
Every realm is ruled by a leading party, the political systems vary from one to another, but monarchy is the most common form.

The wise council, elected every eight years, is there to have a bridge between each dwarf realm. It's purpose is to give to the dwarves an overview of the general situation of the world, spiritually leading them. They also have a really strong political power over the realms. Some mad dwarf kings have already been thrown down by the council. The council is elected by every single dwarf, and any old enough dwarf could be elected. 
When the new council is elected, each wise have to choose 8 person to accompany him. They then go live togetehr in a "cloister".
Practically, they play an important role on general dwarf politic ; If the whole nation has to make choices, it will turn to them.
They also help to keep harmnoy between the realms.
Technically, they have some kind of full power according to dwarf law. They don't use it so much though, their main quest being the harmony and the progress of dwarf kind.

The dwarf society has doesn't really car for gender. A man or a woman can ben the ruler, or a wise, or anything. 
Dwarves normally don't open their cities for other species, but some do live in humans or others town. They don't want to get involved in other folks politic, considering they have to much to do for themselves.

## Geography

Dwarves live in cities and town, nearly always underground, but sometimes not.
These cities can be found everywhere, they don't have preferencies.
Sometimes great underground roads connect different dwarf places, but other times they just have to go outside.
Dwarves normally have good communication systems between cities.
It is said that some secret dwarf nation have underwater cities. But no one truly knows.

## Culture

## Relations with humans

Due to the relative stability and uniformity of dwarf culture, many of their constructs have been used by humans. 
Two important examples of those are justice and currency.
