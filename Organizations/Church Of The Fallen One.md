The church of the fallen one is the biggest religious organization of Kestalis, and of the humans of continent I.
It worships a  powerful god with many different embodiments, through some kind of poly-monotheism.

## History

The church of the fallen one was born when many different small tribes of the north west of continent I decided to ally to build a greater civilization -which will later become the fragmented realm-, but had problems because of different religious beliefs. Then they organized a meeting between every responsible religious of each tribe to talk and try to decide which faith is the best. After only one day of meeting, they all had to agree that their religion where really similar. Their only real discordance was that their holy figure where not the same, and their religious history was different. 

From there they had to think of a way to ally their beliefs. They decided to write a text, creating a new faith, from the old ones, but stating that there is one god, that took and take and will take many different forms to represent himself. 

Thus the edict of the one was born, first dogmatic text of the newly born religion.

The church of the fallen one then spread around the world with many travellers and merchants from the new realm, and made it to Littlefall, where it was welcomed nicely, and evolved first as a minor belief, affecting more the small people. It was an easy faith to accept for many, because they now had a name for destiny and fortuity. They could just change their proto-pagan ways of seeing the life and its meaning, into this new faith.

## Beliefs

The church of the fallen one pretend that a mighty god exists and is there to guide humanity, in a way that humanity can't understand it. To achieve this, the god comes from time to time, choosing a new form, to influence people. His name is The fallen one because in the traditional belief, this god lives upon us and each time he decides to interfere, he falls from the sky to earth. 
The fidels of the church celebrate every evening, the fall of the sun, and every morning, the fall of the moon. 

There are ten sacred behest, written in the edict of the one, that are the basis of the church:

Due to a great diaspora, there are plenty different ways of being a follower of the church of the fallen one, but everyone always recognize these precepts.

## Organization

The church is a really vast organism, communities are spread around the whole world. The church of the origin still is a leading figure in the organization, and play as the bound between all the communities. Every five years, community leader from around the world gather in the temple of the origin to discuss about their faith.
At the end of this seminar, a text is written to describe the evolution of the faith, it's goals, its new dogma and everything else. The talk is leaded by the leader of the first communities.

A community is a group of followers, under the control of one person that swore to serve and worship the fallen one. He had to make his vows on the sacred behest, and under the command of anyone that already swore.
