# The Treaty on Magic
The _Treaty on Magic_ is a series of books about magic divided in multiple volumes.
There is no unique writer but the first volume was mainly achieved by the wizard Brynjar.
If he was a wizard, he was first a scholar, collecting as much informations he could about magic and the way people see it in the world.

## Volume I: Generalities
> There is no school to learn magic, and there are not many wizards either.
> I think most of those seeking power aren't patient enough to spend years learning the ways of the praeter.
> Becoming a wizard is also a lonely path for most, and requires a great discipline too. 
> [...] 
> This is an hard exercice to feel the praeter in general.
> Even in places of power where the task is eased, you will have to be focused and trained to be able to feel it.
> We call the people who can't or never felt the praeter _uninitiated_. 

> In our way of learning magic, the first step for the apprentice is to go in pilgrimage to a common magical place.
> There he must show patience, discipline and spirit opening to start feeling the praeter.
> This first step is usually hard and very shattering once reached.
> In the beginning, the time spent in the praeter is very tiring and long breaks are required between each trip.
> At this point of learning, we call the apprentice a _novice_. 
> [...] 
> As he reaches the status of novice, the real training begins.
> The shaping of the elements is first disorganized and exhausting.
> A long practice within a magical place is required to master it.
> A novice will commonly try to travel from place to place to master the different kinds of magic, as you can't optimally perform any kind anywhere due to the environment.

> We use to call someone a wizard, if he can master one kind of magic at least.
> Most wizard specialize in only one kind of magic, as it requires already a lot of work. 
> [...] 
> There is a small group of talented wizards we call _Archmages_. 
> They have accumulated so much experience in the art of magic that they can enter the praeter in every single places of the world, without using any source of power. 
> [...] 
> I think there is no standard way to become an archmage.
> Anyway, the amount of work to achieve this level of mastery is huge and isn't accessible for everyone.

## Volume I: The Nendal's Folk
This part is about a people living in the Nendal.
It gives a brief overview of their history, religion, vision of the magic and political system.
The major feature covers the reason why magic and religion are so deeply bound within their society.

This part was, as the volume I in general, mainly written by the scholar and wizard Brynjar.
Note that he's not a member of the Nendal's folk and that most of the events he recounts happened decades before him.

> The people of Nendal were at the time ruled by the One Empire of the Rising Moon.
> It all began with the birth of Arkas, whose father died fighting the oppressors. 
> [...] 
> When Arkas' mother died, he was fourteen.
> He was described as lunatic, troubled, and spent a lot of time alone in the wild. 
> [...] 
> He must have found a place of magic and began there to train himself. 
> [...] 
> He came back after a while and said he would watch over his people, free them from the tyranny.
> But these words came to the guards and his affinities with magic weren't enough to protect him.
> They punished him by snatching his eyes.
> That broke him and he retired for the rest of his life.
> Nobody saw him again.

> A decade after these events, a strange newborn came to life.
> He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail.
> This was the first known time in history where a person presented the mark.
> Let me light up this topic: this was the _Mark of Resurrection_. 
> It actually means that the person inside the body used great powers to keep his soul in the praeter after his death, and came back in a newborn's body.
> We know that the beginning in the new body is very difficult because as you grow up, you get memories back from your past lives.
> This process approximately stop at the age of eleven.

> So the young boy grew up with every difficulties inherited from the resurrection.
> He also showed affinities to magic, although he never practiced before.
> We actually think that these affinities could be inherited from the past lives.
> Around the age of six, he started to understand his condition of resurrected, which was a difficult process since he was the first one and nobody knew about that at the time.
> So he started to declare it to his relatives and started naming himself Arkas.
> But obviously nobody believed him, thinking he just read some stories about this character.

> Years later, he was a powerful wizard and showed a great determination to free himself from the oppressors.
> He started a war and first attacked the guards of small villages.
> Therewith, his fame grew and he brought together many warriors.
> Thanks to his amazing powers, the One Empire of the Rising Moon lost many soldiers.
> The difficult fields of the region and the tough climate eventually led them to fall back, abandoning their holds.
> Arkas self-proclaimed himself King and became revered by his people, who saw him as their new god. 
> [..] 
> Afterwards, some wizards among the Nendal's folk reached the level to resurrect themselves.
> They can't perform such magic without being able to enter the praeter in the direct way, but we don't call them archmages.
> Resurrection is actually forbidden in our lands thus we think the soul of the newborn must be sacrificed to let the other one come.
> Therefore we use to call these archmages _Witchers_ for their occult practices.
> They seem to gain more power with each resurrection.

> The people of Nendal actually believe that Arkas and the other witchers are gods that initially lived in the praeter.
> They think that some of them decided to come on earth and, as they are gods, their soul can't die and they can come back as newborns as they please.
> What is actually funny is that most of the witchers believe they are gods, simply assuming that after many resurrections, they just forget their time in the praeter among the other gods. 
> [...] 
> The Nendal's folk also believes that those who can perform magic in a lesser way than their gods are just graciously gifted for their religious involvement.
> They call them _Priests_.

> At the time I'm writing this, the Nendal's folk is ruled by a theocratic government with Arkas as the spiritual leader, and where the revered witchers occupy high functions.
> The people are considered inferiors to the witchers and the king.
> Arkas even adopted the title _King of Gods_. 
> When he rebirths and is still in young age, a provisional council is formed to rule.
> The witchers are very heterogenous.
> Some of them enjoy their powers and status and don't bother with the religious principles, while others are very involved and very strict about it.
> Although it seems there are plans to usurp the throne, most of them are loyal to the king.
> Nevertheless, some of them are just not interested in politics and just focus on other things like magical learning.

## Volume I: The Highlands' Folk
> There is also this pacific folk living in the Highlands.
> They assume that the contact with the praeter represents a way to their God.
> They actually believe that the spiritual awakening leads to the praeter, and that those who reached it are gracefully gifted with magic.
> Their beliefs mention that this gift comes with the mission to protect the weaks.
> Thus the wizards there are called _Monks_ and assume the function of divine guardians blessed by God to watch over the world.

> Unlike our wizards, who mostly act separately, their monks have built temples in the surrounding area of strong magical places and live there, secluded in hierarchized communities.
> We actually don't know their position concerning the practice of resurrection.
