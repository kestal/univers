To make a good puree, you will first have to gather enough Poris mushrooms in the darkest caves of your neighborhood.
Choose them small for a bette taste, and don't forget that the more spots, the better the puree.
Once you have them all, rinse them in thoroughly so as to get rid of all the mices that could have hidden inside.
Put them in a big pot, and add a piece of Quartz and cover the whole with enough beer.
This must be then left alone, with no one in the same room for at least a whole day.
