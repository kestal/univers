#The Codex
The _Codex_ is a compilation of texts about magic and religion written by the people of Nendal (_temporary name_). As they see the praeter as the home of their gods, magic and religion are deeply bound in their beliefs. The Codex somehow acts like a Bible for them.

## The Rise of Arkas
It all begon with the birth of Arkas. We were at the time oppressed by the men from the south and his father died fighting them. When his mother died, he was 14. He was then a very troubled boy and spend a lot of time alone in the wild. We don't know exactly what happened, but when he came back after a while, he said he was here to watch over us, that he would free us from their might. He used already some magic, but he couldn't beat the southeners when they came for him. They punished him by snatching his eyes. He retired and we never saw him again. We thought it was over.

A decay after these events, a strange newborn came to life. He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail. As he grew up, he seemed often distrubted, like if he couldn't undestand something that was going strange, and also showed signs of magic. When he was still just a boy, he started to declare to his relatives that he had another life before, and his true name was Arkas. He wasn't believed and people thought he just read some stories about this character. But as he grew, he became more powerful with magic and showed a determination of free himself from the southeners.

He started to fight the southener guards in small villages, and his fame grew with it. He brought together many warriors. The Great War started. Thanks to his powers, the southeners lost many battle and eventually decided to fall back and abandon their hold.

Since then, as Arkas died he always came back as a newborn. He started being called the King of Gods. Those who could perform magic were called monks. Some monks were powerful enough to became immortal like Arkas, and we said there were his brothers, gods amongs men.
