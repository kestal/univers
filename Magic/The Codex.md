#The Codex
The _Codex_ is a compilation of texts about magic and religion written by the people of Nendal (_temporary name_). As they see the praeter as the home of their gods, magic and religion are deeply bound in their beliefs. The Codex somehow acts like a Bible for them.

## Arkas
It all begon with the birth of Arkas. We were at the time oppressed by the men from the south and his father died fighting them. When his mother died, he was 14. He was described as lunatic, troubled, and spent a lot of time alone into the wild. We don't know exactly what happened, but when he came back after a while, he said he was here to watch over us, that he would free us from their tyranny. He had some affinities with magic but that wasn't enough to defeat the southeners guards when they came for him. They punished him by snatching his eyes. He retired and was never seen again.

A decay after these events, a strange newborn came to life. He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail. As he grew up, he seemed often distrubted, like if he couldn't undestand something that was going strange, and also showed signs of magic. When he was still just a boy, he started to declare to his relatives that he had another life before, and his true name was Arkas. He wasn't believed and people thought he just read some stories about this character. But as he grew, he became more powerful with magic and showed a determination of free himself from the southeners.

He started to fight the southener guards in small villages, and his fame grew with it. He brought together many warriors. The Great War started. Thanks to his powers, the southeners lost many battle and eventually decided to fall back and abandon their hold. Arkas self-proclaimed himself King. Since then, as Arkas died he always came back as a newborn, always with the same mark in the eye. But he wasn't the only one to achieve this miracle, as some other people did it afterwards. The mark in the eye seemed to be the sign of resurrection.

## Gods among men
We believe that Arkas, King of Gods, and his brothers and sisters live in the praeter. Those of them who decided to come on earth have the power to shape the elements. As they are gods, they can't die and come back as newborns if they wish.

We believe that those who can perform magic in a lesser way are blessed by the gods. We call them monks.

We basically remain free thanks to the gods that live with us. They are revered and most of them are holding importances functions in our gouvernment. Arkas is the undisputable King and his powers are absolutes. When he reborns and is still in young age, a council is formed to rule.
