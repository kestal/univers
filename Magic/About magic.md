# 1. The Praeter

## The praeter
The praeter is a part, a dimension of the universe, whose mechanics and relation to the physical universe are not well understood. His access allows trained casters to perform magic. They can either enter the praeter directly or use sources of power displayed around the world.

People aren't born with some gift to perform magic. Although anyone could enter it with the help of a source of power, the contact with the praeter is very exhausting and will basically faint any uninitiated.

## The direct way
Feeling the praeter directly requires years and years of training and a lot of energy. Thereby practically nobody can perform magic this way. Adepts of this methode are extremely powerful.

It is said that some of them could even use the praeter to keep their spirit immortal and even come back in the real world as a newborn. They are sometimes perceived as divine or even as gods by certain folks.

## Sources of power
The most common way to feel the praeter is through sources of power. These act as strong bonds to the praeter dimension and allow the casters to enter it easier.

The only presence of great sources of power can weaken the people nearby and some of the mightiest might even faint any uninitiated.

Sources of power are very heterogeneous in size and power. There are the inert sources of power like magical places and magical streams, and there are the living sources of power like magical beasts and the elves.

Living sources gets exhausted when used and need time to recover, exactly like the caster. However, if pushed to much, they can also faint and even die. Nevertheless, they can defend themselves from the caster in a sort of mental duel.

The magical beast feel the praeter in a natural and strong way, while the elves are more uniques.

# 2. Art of magic

## The learning
An uninitiated who don't open his spirit can't feel the praeter, even when he's near a place of power.
Therefor, becoming a wizard is a long journey of pilgrimage to places of power to learn to open his spirit to feel and get used to the praeter. It's nothing like book reading.

Once the initiated reach a certain level, he can enter the praeter properly. Then he must remain in these low bonds sources of power to progressively reach the level where he can use the praeter to cast spells.

The use of strong bonds sources of power requires a way more important training and is reserved for talented wizards.

The strength and the length of a spell are limited by both the caster and, if used, the source of power.
Performing magic is exhausting for the caster, as draining energy from the praeter requires a great concentration. Although it can't injure the caster physically, it still can faint him in extreme cases.

Casting does not require any gesture, lyrics or ritual. Thus some gesture can make a magical stream flow and perform magic.

## Abjuration
Abjuration is the alteration or removal of magic. This ability also allows uninitiated to defend themselves against direct magical aggression, based on their strengh of caracter.

# 3. Frame of magic

Magic is the way of altering the properties of the world using the praeter dimension. The praeter is first an instantaneous way of communication with other people that also allows to manipulate the minds.

The praeter also allows to alter the energy in the area surrounding the caster in the form of force, light, electricity or temperature. Even if all the sources of powers allow to perform any spells, there are two things to mention: first each different spells need exercice to master, and secondly each spells requires a specific environment to be performed.

## Fundamentals
The following rules are all based on basic physic proprieties and they are indeed really obvious, but it is necessary to mention them since the frame of spells need to be defined.

Magic basically can't create or erase matter, thus it follows the principle that nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed. The only way of shaping light is by absorbing its energy. So you canâ€™t directly create light. Instead, you can shape the temperature or the electicity to make a source produce light. The electricity you shape stills flow preferentially through electrical conductors.

A powerful temperature shaping could start a fire (preferentially on combustible matters) or extinguish it, but in general it will change the state of matter. Note also that a well calculated temperature shaping could provoke snowing, for example.

## The fireball case
Lets imagine casting a fireball with this approach. You will basically need some combustible matter, like a little wood stick, to set it on fire and eventually throw it.
