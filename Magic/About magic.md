# The Praeter

This world is in contact with the praeter.
The praeter is a part, a dimension of the universe, whose mechanics and relation to the physical universe are not well understood.
Those who can feel the praeter have access to a whole variety of unnatural abilities called magic.

But its access is difficult though eased by bridges displayed around the world in the form of jumpy streams.
Note that people aren't born with some gift to perform magic.
So anyone could basically become a wizard.

## A direct way
Entering the praeter directly requires years and years of training and a lot of energy.
Thereby practically nobody can perform magic this way.
Adepts of this method are extremely powerful.

A wizard holding both amazing powers and dreadful hatred could keep his soul alive breifly when striked by death, roaming in the preater bearing a terrible pain.
Thenforth, he should die or quickly find a newborn's body to take his place.

## Magical streams
The most common way to feel the praeter is through magical streams.
These bridges act as strong bonds to the praeter dimension and allow the casters to enter it easier.
They can't been seen or touched and are usually jumpy and tiny (cm).

However, sometimes they highly concentrate in areas called magical places.
These wide (m->km) places tend to be stable for decays at least.

The [elves](/Species/Elves.md) have special affinities with the praeter, which allow them to incorporate magical streams, becoming themselves sources.
They can get exhausted if used and, if pushed to much, can faint and even die.
Finally, although there are magical beasts, they don't act as sources of power.

# Art of magic

## Feeling the praeter
To feel the praeter is an hard exercise.
Even in the vicinity of a strong source of power, where the task is eased, a important focus and training is required.
The people who can't or never felt the praeter are commonly called uninitiated.

The first step in order to feel the praeter is to open his spirit near a good source of power.
Thereby, becoming a wizard is a long learning to feel and get used to the praeter, nothing like book reading.

However, note that some of the mightiest sources of power can weaken the people nearby even if there are uninitiated.

## Feeling a disruption
When the preater is used to shape the reality, is leaves marks.
These can be felt even by an unitiated.
This abiltiy is more like a natural gift, but can be learned or increased with practice.
The ability the feel the praeter helps a lot for it but isn't necessary at all.

## Casting spells
Feel the praeter is an difficult exercise in itself, but using it to cast spells is a huge learning.
Performing magic requires a great concentration and can be very exhausting.
The more the spell shapes the world, the higher the concentration is needed.

Sources of power are bonds that allow to use the preater easier.
If a novice use a strong source to cast a spell too powerfull for him, he will faint and harm himself badly.

Casting basically does not require any lyrics or ritual.
However, it requires to lead the magical streams.
Although it can be done by though, some gesture are also used to make them flow as wished.

# Frame of magic

Magic is the way of altering the properties of the world using the praeter dimension.
The practice of magic can be restricted in four ways:
- Source of power: almost always needed.
- Caster's ability: a good experience for the casted spell is required in order to perform it effectively.
- Caster's energy: performing magic is a hard mental exercise, thus the caster must have enough energy in order to be efficient.
- Environment: some spells ranged in a category called alteration rely mostly on physical proprieties, and therefore need an adequate environment.

Some wizard divided magic into three big categories to sort the huge amount of spells they knew.
We will use them to present the different way the preater can be used.

## Alteration
The praeter allows to alter the energy in the area surrounding the caster.
These kind of spells heavely rely on basic physical proprieties.
There are better explained with some examples:
- Light: the only way of shaping light is by absorbing its energy. So you canâ€™t directly create light. Instead, you can shape the energy of a material to make it produce light.
- Electricity: the electricity you shape stills flow preferentially through electrical conductors.
- Temperature: a powerful temperature shaping could start a fire (preferentially on combustible matters) or extinguish it, but in general it will change the state of matter. Note also that a well calculated temperature shaping could provoke snowing, for example.
- Telekinesis: the shaping of forces allows to perform most abilities belonging to the telekinesis.

## Obspiration
The praeter is also an instantaneous way of communication with other people that also allows to change the behavior of an human or an animal.
Obspiration is a term used to describe the mind manipulation.
Instead of directly communicate with someone, you can make a emotion grow into him or whisper thoughts to him.
It also works on animals but can't reach the same level since the communication is harder.

## Abnition
Term used to describe the reduction or removal of magic.
These sorts of counterspells are used to restrict a caster or to defend against direct magical aggression.
They aren't really considered as spells and have a special way of learning that rely more on the feeling of disruption.
This way, an uninitiated can also use these abilities.
