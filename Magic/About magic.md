# The Praeter

This world is in contact with the praeter.
The praeter is a part, a dimension of the universe, whose mechanics and relation to the physical universe are not well understood.

Its access is however restrained by bridges displayed around the world in the form of jumpy streams.
Those who can enter the praeter have access to a whole variety of unnatural abilities called magic. 

## Enter the praeter
The most common way to enter the praeter is through magical streams.
These bridges act as strong bonds to the praeter dimension and eased its access. They can't been seen or touched and are usually jumpy and tiny (cm).

Sometimes these streams highly concentrate in areas called magical places.
These wide (m->km) places tend to be stable for decays at least.

The [elves](/Species/Elves.md) have special affinities with the praeter, which allow them to incorporate magical streams, becoming themselves sources.
More explicitly, strong wizards can extract these magical streams from them.
But this process get the elves exhausted.
If pushed to much, they can faint or even die.

Another way is to enter the praeter directly. It requires yet years and years of training and a lot of energy.
Thereby practically nobody can perform magic this way. Adepts of this method are extremely powerful and use to be called archmages.

> According to legends, an archmage striked by death would have kept his soul alive for an instant, roaming in the preater bearing a terrible pain. Thenforth, he quickly would have found a newborn's body and taken his place.

Finally, there are creatures or monsters that can use magic. However, they don't act as sources of power.

# Art of magic

## Streams and disruptions
The access to the praeter is achieved through magical streams.
In order to use these streams, a spellcaster must first be able to feel them.
This process is an hard exercise and requires a lot of focus and training.
The people who can't or never felt magical streams are commonly called uninitiated.

When the praeter is used to shape the reality, it leaves marks knowned as disruptions.
They can be felt even by an unitiated.
This ability is more like a natural gift, but can be learned or increased with practice.

Being able to feel magical streams helps feeling disruptions, but isn't necessary at all.
Note that these feelings are independents of our common senses.
Thus, disabilities like blindness or deafness don't affect them.

## Casting spells
When accustomed to feel magical streams, a novice will learn to attract them and finally to lead them.
Although it can all be done by though, some gesture can be used to catch them and to make them flow as wished.

As the novice controls the magical streams, he can use them to enter the praeter and shape the world.
In short, becoming a wizard is a long learning that looks nothing like book reading.

Performing magic requires a great concentration and can be very exhausting.
The more the spell shapes the world, the higher the concentration is needed.
If a novice try to cast a spell too powerfull for him, he will faint and eventually harm himself badly.
To conclude, casting basically does not require any lyrics or ritual, and anyone have the oportunity to learn it.

# Frame of magic

Magic is the way of altering the properties of the world using the praeter dimension.
The practice of magic can be restricted in four ways:
- Source of power: almost always needed.
- Caster's ability: a good experience for the casted spell is required in order to perform it effectively.
- Caster's energy: performing magic is a hard mental exercise, thus the caster must have enough energy in order to be efficient.

Some wizard divided magic into three big categories to sort the huge amount of spells they knew.
We will use them to present the different way the preater can be used.
Note that the basic abilities like feeling, attracting and leading magical streams aren't included.

## Alteration
The praeter allows to alter the energy in the area surrounding the caster.
These kind of spells heavely rely on basic physical proprieties.
There are better explained with some examples:
- Light: the only way of shaping light is by absorbing its energy. So you canâ€™t directly create light. Instead, you can shape the energy of a material to make it produce light.
- Electricity: the electricity you shape stills flow preferentially through electrical conductors.
- Temperature: a powerful temperature shaping could start a fire (preferentially on combustible matters) or extinguish it, but in general it will change the state of matter. Note also that a well calculated temperature shaping could provoke snowing, for example.
- Telekinesis: the shaping of forces allows to perform most abilities belonging to the telekinesis.

## Obspiration
The praeter is also an instantaneous way of communication with other people that also allows to change the behavior of an human or an animal.
Obspiration is a term used to describe the mind manipulation.
Instead of directly communicate with someone, you can make a emotion grow into him or whisper thoughts to him.
It also works on animals but can't reach the same level since the communication is harder.

## Abnition
Term used to describe the reduction or removal of magic.
These sorts of counterspells are used to restrict a caster or to defend against direct magical aggression.
Concretely, the magical streams that began to be used to shape the world, creating a disruption, will be rejected and thus canceled.
These abilities rely on the feeling of disruptions, and are therefore usable by uninitiated too.
