# The Treaty on Magic
The _Treaty on Magic_ is a series of books about magic divided in multiple volumes. There is no unique writer but the first volume was mainly achieved by the wizard Brynjar. If he was a wizard, he was first a scholar, collecting as much informations he could about magic and the way people see it in the world.

## Volume I: Generalities
> This is a hard exercice to feel the praeter in general. Even in places of power where the task is eased, you will have to be focused and trained to be able to feel it. We use to call the people who can't or never felt the praeter _uninitiated_. It is highly forbidden to give a great source of power like a gemstone to an uninitiated ; he may faint or even die. [...]

> In your way to learning the magic, the first step for the apprentice is to go in pilgrimage to a common magical place. There he must show patience, discipline and spirit opening to start feeling the praeter. This first step is usually hard and very shattering once reached. In the beginning, the time spend in the praeter is very tiring and long breaks are required between each trip. At this point of learning, we use to call the apprentice a _novice_. [...]

> Since he reaches the status of novice, the real training begins. The shaping of the elements is first disorganized and exhausting. A long practice within a magical place is required to master it. A novice will commonly try to travel from places to places to master the different kind of magic, as you can't perform any kind anywhere. [...]

> We use to call someone a wizard, if he can master one kind of magic. Most wizard specialize in one kind of magic, as it requires already a lot of work. But there are of course some wizard that can master many kinds of magic. [...]

> There is a small group of people we call _Archmages_. They have accumulated so much experience in the art of magic that they can enter the praeter in every single places of the world, without using any source of power.
I think there is no defined way to become an archmage. For example one went to hermitage while another practiced with gemstones. Anyway the work to achieve this level of mastery is huge and is not made for everyone. Maybe the archmages are also simply more talented than others for magic. [...]

> There is no school to learn magic, and there are no many wizards too. I think those seeking for power don't want to spend years patiently learning the ways of the praeter, as they simply can learn quickly how to use a weapon instead. Becoming a wizard is also a lonely path for the most, and it requires yet a great discipline.

## Volume I: The Nendal's Folk
This part is about a people living in the Nendal. Its subjects are mainly their history, religion, vision of the magic and political system. As they see the praeter as the home of their gods, magic and religion are deeply bound in their beliefs.

This part was, as the volume I in general, mainly written by the scholar and wizard Brynjar. Note that he's not a member of the Nendal's folk and that most of the events he recounts happened decays before him.

> The people of Nendal were at the time ruled by the Southeners. It all begon with the birth of Arkas, whose father died fighting the oppressors. When his mother died, Arkas was fourteen. He was described as lunatic, troubled, and spent a lot of time alone into the wild. He must have found a place of magic and began there to train himself. He came back after a while and said he would watch over his people, free them from the tyranny. But these words came to the Southeners and his affinities with magic weren't enough to protect him. They punished him by snatching his eyes. That broke him and he retired for the rest of his life. Nobody saw him again.

> A decay after these events, a strange newborn came to life. He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail. This was the first knowned time in history where a person presented the mark. Let me light up this topic: this was the _Mark of Resurrection_. It actually means that the person inside the body used great powers to keep his soul in the praeter after his death, and came back in a newborn's body. The beginning in a new body is by the way very difficult because as you grow up, you get memories back from your past lives. This process stop at the age of eleven approximatelly.

> So the young boy grew up with every difficulties inherited from the ressurection. He also showed affinities to magic, although he never practice before. Arround the age of six, he started to understand his condition of ressurected, which was a difficult process since he was the first one and nobody knew about that at the time. So he started to declare it to his relatives and began to name himself Arkas. But obviously nobody believed him, thinking he just read some stories about this character.

> Years later, he was a powerful wizard and showed a great determination to free himself from the Southeners. He started a war  and first attacked guards of small villages. Therewith, his fame grew and he brought together many warriors. Thanks to his amazing powers, the Southeners lost many battles and eventually decided the war wasn't worth it and fell back, abandoning their holds. Arkas self-proclaimed himself King.

> Afterwards, some other people among the Nendal's folk reached the level to ressurect themselves. We personally call them archmages since they can't perform such magic without being able to enter the praeter in the direct way, meaning without the help from any source of power. The people of Nendal actually believe that Arkas and the other archmages are gods that initially live in the praeter. They think that some of them decided to come on earth and, as they are gods, their soul can't die and they can come back as newborn as they please. What is actually funny is that most of their archmages believe they are gods, simply assuming that after many ressurections, they just forget their time in the praeter.

> The Nendal's folk also believe that those who can perform magic in a lesser way than the archmages are blessed by the gods. They call them monks. At the time I'm writing this, this folk basically remains free thanks to their strong archmages. They are therefor revered and most of them are holding important functions in the gouvernment. Arkas is still the undisputable King and is even called _King of Gods_. When he reborns and is still in young age, a council is formed to rule.
