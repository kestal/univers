# The Treaty on Magic
The _Treaty on Magic_ is a series of books about magic divided in multiple volumes. There is no unique writer but the first volume was mainly achieved by the wizard Brynjar. If he was a wizard, he was first a scholar, collecting as much informations he could about magic and the way people see it in the world.



## Volume I
This volume was mainly written by the scholar and wizard Brynjar.

### Generalities
> There is no school to learn magic, and there are no many wizards too. Although anyone can learn it, I think most of the people aren't patient enough to learn the ways of the praeter. Because becoming a wizard is long and difficult path, requiring a great discipline. [...] This is an hard exercice to feel the praeter. It is almost always done in the vicinity of a source of power. They can appears as static and large places, or in the form of tiny jumpy streams. It requires a great focus and training. We use to call the people who can't or never felt the praeter uninitiated. Furthermore, some of the mightiest magical places are forbidden to uninitiated, as they may feel disturbed, or even faint.

> In our way of learning magic, the first step for the apprentice is to spend time in a common magical place. There he must show patience, discipline and spirit opening to start feeling the praeter. This first step is usually hard and very shattering once reached. In the beginning, the time spent in the praeter is very tiring and long breaks are required between each session. [...] As he reaches the status of novice, the real training begins. The shaping of the elements is first disorganized and exhausting, and long practices are required to master it.

> The wizards who wish to be polyvalent might travel from places to places to train shaping different elements. But most wizards specialize in only one variety of spells, as it requires already a lot of work. [...] There is a small group of talented wizards we call Archmages. They have accumulated so much experience in the art of magic that they can enter the praeter in every single places of the world, without using any source of power. [...] I think there is no defined way to become an archmage, exept that the amonth of work to achieve this level of mastery is huge and isn't accessible for everyone.

### The spellslayers
> The spellslayers are the member of an ancient guild. The first schools appeared in the dwarven kingdoms, prey to terrible monsters. The trainging of a spellslayer was about weapon practice and the art of abnition, the anti-magic.

> So the spellslayers were initially monster hunters. Their ability to avoid the magic these creatures displayed made them perfect for the task. But then, they began to fight spellcasters that misused their powers.


### The Rackonian Great Purge
> Rackonia is a northern kingdom surrounded by mountains. The region is poor and not much populated. In 7'328, I traveled to Kilmare, the capital city located in the south. I met there an old friend called Frár. He was a dwarven spellslayer. He had mixed feelings about a sect that merged there during the past months. They condemned magic in all its forms. I took his advice and investigated the following weeks.

> Unfortunately, this sect had more adepts I could imagine. Furthermore, a holy court had been secretly established: the Inquisition. The new institution had also bribed a spellslayer and asked him to train their most devoted adepts, who would be called later the inquisitors.

> Then the Great Purge began. Witches, sorcerers, druids, wizards and anyone who supported them were hunted and slayed during a bloody massacre. I managed to escape, but a very few had this chance. The neighboring Kingdoms asked the king to stop this sect, but nothing happened. The sect became the new religion in Rackonia.

### The Highlands' Folk
> There is also this pacific folk living in the Highlands. They assume that the contact with the praeter represent a way to their God. They actually believe that the spiritual awakening leads to the praeter, and that those who reached it are gracefully gifted with magic. Their beliefs mention that this gift comes with the mission to protect the weaks. Thus the wizards there are called Monks and assume the function of divine guardians blessed by God to watch over the world.

> Unlike our wizards, who mostly act seperatly, their monks have built temples in the surrounding area of strong magical places and live there, secluded in hierarchized communities. They are especially knowned for using obspiration to improve the moral of people.

## Volume II
This volume was written many years after the death of the wizard Brynjar

### Of hatred he arises
This part recounts the events related to the rise of the infamous archmage Snákur.

> 7'329, Rackonia. The Great Purge was just beginning. Markas was a young boy, exceptionally gifted for magic. As it wasn't well seen, he never told anyone about this, except his best friend. But he got betrayed, and his parents, seeing evil in their son, delivered him to the inquisitors to purify him. They snatched his eyes and abandoned him into the wild. Miraculously, he was picked up by an old woman that lived reclusively in the woods. She healed him and took care of him for seven years. He was nineteen when he buried her. He trained his magical affinities relentlessly. Many years later, he found something he never thought: love. She gave him a little girl, Arumia, but died during the birth.

> His daughter was everything to him. She wasn't allowed to meet any stranger. When she grew older, she developed the same affinity for magic. But he forbade her to ever use it. One day, as she was a little further from the house that usual, she saw a young boy. He came at the same place regularly, and she started to observe him. Once, he saw her. She broke her father's rule and met him. The fell in love. One day she chose to show him her magic. The next week, they met at the usual place, but he wasn't alone. The fellows he brought started hunting her. She got harmed and screamed. They eventually catched her up. As she struggled, one of them strongly struck her head.

> Markas came breathless. "Leave her alone !" he yelled. The inquisitors around her commanded him to move back. "Arumia !" he called. He called again. But there was no response. He started crying. An inquisitor got closer to him, and felt it instantly: "Wizard !" he screamed. But it was too late. A large branch broke of a tree and sweeped him fiercly. The rest of the group got into formation. Markas immediately felt his powers weaken. As they surrounded him, one of them attacked. A strong shock wave come from the old man, repelling the assailant. Thus another assault came, and a sharped blade pierced the wizard who fell on his knees. "Cursed you all !" he hissed of an immeasurable hate. An inquisitor came from behind and beheaded him.



> 7'375, Rackonia. The Great Purge had ended for more than forty years. Inquisitors were recruited outside the realm. The neighboring kingdoms had been slowly infected by the Holy Church, which spread like the plague. A newborn came to life after endless cries. His name was Keiran. He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail. This was the first knowned time in history where a person presented the mark. Let me light up this topic: this was the Mark of Resurrection. It actually means that a dying person used great powers to keep his soul in the praeter after his death, and came back in the newborn's body. We know that the beginning in the new body is very difficult because as you grow up, you get memories back from your past lives. This process approximatelly stop at the age of eleven.

> So the young boy grew up with every difficulties inherited from the ressurection. Arround the age of six, he started to understand his condition of ressurected, which was a difficult process since he was the first one and nobody knew about that at the time. He also showed strong affinities to magic, although he never practiced before. Yet he wisely told nobody about it.

> Years later, he came with an evil plan of revenge. He told he was send by the one true god. He said magic was a gift given by god, and the Holy Church was an heresy and he had been sent to wash their sins. These words came soon to the inquisition. He was chased and executed publicly. Before he died, he proclaimed: "Do not fear. Cause they can't kill me. I a son of god, and will return to fulfill his will."

> Somewhere in the city that night, a boy came to life, with the same mark in the eye. His parents were immediately convinced. They called him Keiran and protected him from the Church. As he grew up, he gained more and more followers. He told them that the sins of the Church could only be washed in blood, and so started a war, later knowned as the Blood Communion. They managed to overthrow the Church from the capital Kilmare, and proclaimed Keiran as the new king. He took back his first name: Markas. His opponents gave him the infamous name Snákur, meaning snake, while the Highlands' folk called him later Cheremow, meaning the snake demon. Nontheless, he was revered by his people, who saw him as a god.

> At the time I'm writing this, Rackonia is ruled by a theocratic government with Markas as the spiritual leader. Spellcasters have come back and ancient adepts of the Church have fleed mostly to the neighborough kingdoms. A cult of magic has developed there, and many places of power have been turned into holy schools, where only the richest can afford to send a child. Magic there is used and misused without restrictions or morals. Markas is described as a cold and cruel despot, seeking to exterminate every remaining adept of the Church.
