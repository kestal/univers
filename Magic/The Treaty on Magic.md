# The Treaty on Magic
The _Treaty on Magic_ is a series of books about magic divided in multiple volumes. There is no unique writer but the first volume was mainly achieved by the wizard Brynjar.

## Excerpts of Volume I
> This is a hard exercice to feel the praeter in general. Even in places of power where the task is eased, you will have to be focused and trained to be able to feel it. We use to call the people who can't or never felt the praeter _uninitiated_. It is highly forbidden to give a great source of power like a gemstone to an uninitiated ; he may faint or even die.

> In your way to learning the magic, the first step for the apprentice is to go in pilgrimage to a common magical place. There he must show patience, discipline and spirit opening to start feeling the praeter. This first step is usually hard and very shattering once reached. In the beginning, the time spend in the praeter is very tiring and long breaks are required between each trip. At this point of learning, we use to call the apprentice a _novice_.

> Since he reaches the status of novice, the real training begins. The shaping of the elements is first disorganized and exhausting. A long practice within a magical place is required to master it. Some sources of power are also more specifics to some kind of magic. These are like bridges opening only few doors to the praeter. This way, it is common for a novice to travel from places to places to master the differents elements.

> There is a small group of people we call _Archmages_. They have accumulated so much experience in the art of magic that they can enter the praeter in every single places of the world, without using any source of power.
I think there is no defined way to become an archmage. For example one went to hermitage while another practiced with gemstones. Anyway the work to achieve this level of mastery is huge and is not made for everyone. Maybe the archmages are also simply more talented than others for magic.
