# Schools of magic

The great variety of spells that can be casted can be divided schools of magic.

Magic in Kestal is the way of shaping to world. It follows first the law of conservation of mass: "nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed". So magic basically can't create or erase matter.
Instead, it uses simplified versions of the physical properties of the world to shape it. However, the praeter brings also a abstract concept that allows telepathy, which does not rely on any physical property.

## The common schools

### Telepathy
The Praeter is an instantaneous way of communication with other people.

When mastered, this also allows to manipulate the minds.

### Telekinesis
The way of altering the forces in the surrounding area.

### Lightbending
The way of altering the light.

Allows to increase of decrease the brightness in the surrounding area, without however allowing to turn of a source of light.

When mastered, this also allows to create such powerful light that it start burning.

### Thrillcraft
The way of altering electricity.

Allows to create an electrical shock in the surrounding area.

When mastered, this also allows to provoke a lightning.

This type follows the basic rules of electricity, so that is flow preferentially through electrical conductors.

### Firebending
The way of increasing temperature.

Allows to heat objects in the surrounding area.

When mastered, this also allows to provoke a fire.

This type follows the basic rules of the state of matters, so that some materials are easier to get liquid/gaseous than others.

### Frostbending
The way of decreasing temperature.

Allows to froze objects in the surrounding area and thus provoke snowing if well calculated.

When mastered, this also allows to turn water into ice.

This type follows the basic rules of the state of matters, so that some materials are easier to get solid/liquid than others.

## Preferential sources
There are two types of sources of power: generic or specific. Generic sources allow the caster to perform any kind of magic, while specific sources allow the caster to perform only in a specific school. The specifics sources of power can be seen as bridges that only open certain doors to the praeter.

Eventually, the caster can perform any kind of magic when using no source of power. It's exactly like if he used a generic source of power.

Lets imagine casting a fireball with this approach. First you would need some fuel, lets take a little wood stick. Then you will have to use the firebending (or lightbending) to set it on fire and eventually the telekinesis to throw it.
