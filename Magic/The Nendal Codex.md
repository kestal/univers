#The Nendal Codex
The _Nendal Codex_ is a compilation of texts concerning the people of Nendal. Some of these texts are written by foreigners that don't actually belong to the Nendal's folk. It is maily about their history, religion, vision of the magic and political system.

_People of Nendal is a temporary name. They could look like Azetec tribe living in jungles or like norse tribes living in some cold and mountainous places. In any cases, they wouldn't be the most developped people in the time where Arkas rises._

As they see the praeter as the home of their gods, magic and religion are deeply bound in their beliefs. The Codex somehow acts like a Bible for them.

## Treaty on Magic - Volume I
This treaty was mainly written by the wizard Brynjar. He's not a member of the Nendal's folk.

> The people of Nendal were at the time ruled by the Southeners. It all begon with the birth of Arkas, whose father died fighting the oppressors. When his mother died, Arkas was fourteen. He was described as lunatic, troubled, and spent a lot of time alone into the wild. He must have found a place of magic and began there to train himself. He came back after a while and said he would watch over his people, free them from the tyranny. But these words came to the Southeners and his affinities with magic weren't enough to protect him. They punished him by snatching his eyes. That broke him and he retired for the rest of his life. Nobody saw him again.

> A decay after these events, a strange newborn came to life. He had a mark in his right eye, described as the image of a snake biting its own tail. This was the oldest person knowned in history that presented the mark. This is the _Mark of Resurrection_, which actually means that the person inside the body used great powers to keep his soul in the praeter after his death, and came back in a newborn's body. The beginning in a new body is first very difficult because as you grow up, you get memories back from your past lives. This process stop at the age of eleven approximatelly.

> So the young boy grew up with every difficulties inherited from the ressurection. He also showed affinities to magic, although he never practice before. Arround the age of six, he started to understand his condition of ressurected, which was a difficult process since he was the first one and nobody knew about that at the time. So he started to declare it to his relatives and began to name himself Arkas. But obviously nobody believed him, thinking he just read some stories about this character. With the time, he became more powerful with magic and showed a great determination to free himself from the southeners.

> He started to fight the southener guards in small villages, and his fame grew with it. He brought together many warriors. The Great War started. Thanks to his powers, the southeners lost many battle and eventually decided to fall back and abandon their hold. Arkas self-proclaimed himself King. Since then, as Arkas died he always came back as a newborn, always with the same mark in the eye. But he wasn't the only one to achieve this miracle, as some other people did it afterwards. The mark in the eye seemed to be the sign of resurrection.

## Gods among men
We believe that Arkas, King of Gods, and his brothers and sisters live in the praeter. Those of them who decided to come on earth have the power to shape the elements. As they are gods, they can't die and come back as newborns if they wish.

We believe that those who can perform magic in a lesser way are blessed by the gods. We call them monks.

We basically remain free thanks to the gods that live with us. They are revered and most of them are holding important functions in our gouvernment. Arkas is the undisputable King and his powers are absolutes. When he reborns and is still in young age, a council is formed to rule.
