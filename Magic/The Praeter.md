# Magic in Kestal: the praeter

## The praeter
The praeter is a dimension where casters drain power to perform magic. The casters are simply called wizards, sorcerers or warlock.
_It basically functions like the Warhammer's warp.

## The direct way
Casters can enter the praeter directly but it requires years and years of training and a lot of energy. Thereby practically nobody can perform magic this way.

These people are extremely powerful and it is said that some of them could even use the warp to keep their spirit immortal and even come back in the real world as a newborn. They could be perceived as divine or even as gods by certain folks.

## Sources of power
Casters can also, and more commonly, use sources of power that act as strong bonds to the praeter dimension.

## Limits
The strength and the length of a spell are limited by both the caster and, if used, the source of power.

## Casting
Performing magic is exhausting for the caster, as draining energy from the warp requires a great concentration. Although it can't injure the caster physically, it still can faint him in extreme cases.
Casting does not require any gesture, lyrics or ritual, but it needs almost always a source of power. A proper training allows to perform longer and stronger spells.
