# 3. Frame of magic

Magic is the way of altering the properties of the world using the praeter dimension. The praeter is first an instantaneous way of communication with other people that also allows to manipulate the minds. The praeter also allows to alter forces, light, electricity, temperature and other properties in the area surrounding the caster.

## Some rules
Magic basically can't create or erase matter, thus it follows the law of conservation of mass ("nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed"). You can't definitely turn off a source of light by shaping the light directly. You will need to shape the forces or the temperature. A powerful light can start burning. The electricity you shape stills flow preferentially through electrical conductors.

A powerful heat will either start tu burn (preferentially on combustible matter) or either change the state of matter (getting liquid or gaseous). A well calculated cold can provoke snowing. A powerful cold will either extinguish a fire or either change the state of matter (getting liquid or solid).

## The fireball case
Lets imagine casting a fireball with this approach. First you would need some combustible matter, lets take a little wood stick. Then you will have to shape its _temperature_ to set it on fire and eventually shape the _forces_ to throw it.
