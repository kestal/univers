# Frame of magic

Magic in Kestal is the way of altering the properties of the world using the praeter dimension. The praeter is first an instantaneous way of communication with other people that also allows to manipulate the minds. The praeter can also alter the forces, the light, the electricity, the temperature and other properties in the area surrounding the caster.

_It does not have the goal or the pretention to master all the physical properties, but it is based on the idea to work with them. It also makes the magic quite complicated. But I think it forces the writers to use magic as a complex and interesting tool, and not as an easy way of providing a show and/or as an easy way out of problems.
Having a precise frame also ensure the consistency between several writings._

## Some rules
Magic basically can't create or erase matter, thus it follows the law of conservation of mass ("nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed"). You can't definitely turn off a source of light by shaping the light directly. You will need to shape the forces or the temperature. A powerful light can start burning. The electricity you shape stills flow preferentially through electrical conductors.

A powerful heat will either start tu burn (preferentially on combustible matter) or either change the state of matter (getting liquid or gaseous). A well calculated cold can provoke snowing. A powerful cold will either extinguish a fire or either change the state of matter (getting liquid or solid).

## Preferential sources
There are two types of sources of power: generic or specific. Generic sources allow the caster to perform any kind of magic, while specific sources allow the caster to perform only specific spells. The specifics sources of power can be seen as bridges that only open certain doors to the praeter.

Eventually, the caster can perform any kind of magic when using no source of power. It's exactly like if he used a generic source of power.

Lets imagine casting a fireball with this approach. First you would need some combustible matter, lets take a little wood stick. Then you will have to shaping its _temperature_ to set it on fire and eventually shape the _forces_ to throw it.
