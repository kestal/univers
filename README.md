Part of the interest of the thing is to see how well tools like version control, issues and collaborative FLOSS writing can apply to worldbuilding.

# Rules
* The world/style is **fantasy**, more precisely Magical Post Realist Fantasy (MPRF).
* Year zero is the birth of some important, possibly world-changing character.
* We are currently *some* (to be defined) year after their birth.

# Formatting
