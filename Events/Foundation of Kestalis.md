## Arrival of the founders
After fleeing from the [Cartel-Mafia](/Organisations/The Cartel-Mafia.md) and the events of the [Coup of Littlefall](/Events/Coup of Littlefall.md), [Queen Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) and her family, aboard the ships of prince [Testur](/Characters/Testur.md), finally reached the coasts of [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md).
Upon finding a well placed bay, they decided to settle there.
[Testur](/Characters/Testur.md), whose goal was the exploration of [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md), left them there with 3Â of his ships and some of his men, and continued to the south-west.

## Early years
During the first year, the settlers mainly lived of fishing and trading with the neighboring fisher communities.
The riches they had taken with them, along with some of [Testur](/Characters/Testur.md)'s allowed them to have a lot to trade with the fishers.
The quickly started to build shelters, mixing local techniques with those taken with them from [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md).

After one year, and feeling sufficiently stable to lose one of their ships, they sent one to the [Southern Islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md) to hopefully get some help and information.
