## Arrival of the founders
After fleeing from the [Cartel-Mafia]() and the events of the [Coup of Littlefall](), [Queen Alianne]() and her family, aboard the ships of prince [Testur](), finally reached the coasts of [Continent II]().
Upon finding a well placed bay, they decided to settle there.
[Testur](), whose goal was the exploration of [Continent II](), left them there with 3Â of his ships and some of his men, and continued to the south-west.

## Early years
During the first year, the settlers mainly lived of fishing and trading with the neighboring fisher communities.
The riches they had taken with them, along with some of [Testur]()'s allowed them to have a lot to trade with the fishers.
The quickly started to build shelters, mixing local techniques with those taken with them from [Continent I]().

After one year, and feeling sufficiently stable to lose one of their ships, they sent one to the [Southern Islands]() to hopefully get some help and information.
