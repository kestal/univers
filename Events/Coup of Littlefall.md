[Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), king of [Forth](/Geography/Forth (kingdom).md) died of natural causes, on the 45th day of spring.
According to the law of the kingdom, his spouse, [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) was to inherit power.
After announcing his death to the people of [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) decided for 8 days of mourning, and retired, with her children to be alone during this period.
[Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md), high priest of the [Church of the Fallen One](/Organisations/Church Of The Fallen One.md), who advised the queen for this extended mourning, tipped the [Mafia-Cartel](Organi) beforehand.
In the night of the seventh day of mourning, the [Mafia-Cartel](Org), along with some hundreds paid mercenaries, simultaneously attacked the royal castle and other strategic places in the city, having bribed part of the personnel of the city guard.
This forced the royal family to flee.

## Fleeing of the royal family

The royal family, having no other choice than to get away from the city, decided to flee to the coastal city of [Tabadum](/Geography/City of Tabadum.md), where the queen had family, and a secure location to retreat to.
After three days of riding to the west, they reached the outskirts of the city, and set up camp there while waiting for one of their servitors to scout in the city and see if there was no danger.
At the return of the servitor, they got informed that the city was also under the rule of the [Cartel-Mafia](); it wasn't safe for them to stay there; they had no other choice than to flee further away.

At this time, prince [Testur](/Characters/Testur.md), leading a flotilla of a dozen ships, was staying in [Tabadum](/Geography/City of Tabadum.md) for a final resupply before sailing west to explore [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md), which was only known by hear-say in [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md) and the [Southern Islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md).

Fortunately for the royal family, prince [Testur](/Characters/Testur.md) accepted to take them aboard his ships and to hasten his departure.
The family reached his ships in the cover of the night, taking with them only a handful of their servitors.
After many weeks of sailing west, they finally reached [Continent II]().

## Preparation of the Coup

During the latter part of his reign, King [Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) took many measures to lower the influence of the [Cartel-Mafia](/Organisations/The Cartel-Mafia.md) in his kingdom, who had grown to dangerous heights during his predecessor's reign and the beginning of his.
Money lending was forbidden in [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), the number of the city guard increased and bounties given on members of the organization.
This strategy worked, but not as well as needed.
The [Cartel-Mafia](/Organisations/The Cartel-Mafia.md) mainly went subsurface in [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) and started spreading their influence more evenly in the kingdom.
After learning of his declining health by [Priest Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md), they started preparing for getting their power back.
They knew that as long as [Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) was in power, they couldn't do anything, and therefore planned for a coup during the necessarily fragile transition that would take place at his death.
In the months before his death, they started by first testing the waters on which influential members of the government could be turned to their cause, and how.
They then placed agents of theirs in many important cities and places in [Forth](), and mainly in [Littlefall](), and waited for the death of the king.

## Consequences

After taking the power, the [Mafia-Cartel]() put one of their member at the head of the state, for official purposes at least.
They announced that he was the chosen heir of the throne, as decided by the king.
