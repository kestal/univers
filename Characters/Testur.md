Testur Tastatur, prince of [Tatur](/Geography/Tatur.md), in the [Southern Islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md).
He is known for having helped [Queen Alianne]() and her children flee after the [Coup of Littlefall](/Events/Coup of Littlefall.md),
and for his exploration of [Continent II](), which led to an epic autobiagriphical book, called “Testur Tastatur, adventures in the country of the elves”.

He is the first of the islanders to reach as far as [Continent II](); one of the reason for this is his lack of belief in the old mythology, which made many islanders fearful of adventuring themselves too far away from the archipel.
