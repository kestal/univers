Jebus, son of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) and brother to [Marihe](/Characters/Marihe.md) and [Jahob](), was one of the founders and ruler of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).

Even though he was still young during the first years of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md), he is considered a founder du to his strong implication in its construction, mainly the urban planning.

During the years of ruling by his mother [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md), Jebus helped her with his siblings, and at her death, the three of them shared the power.
Jebus was an advocate of non-invasive ruling and considered that a good chief of state should merely rule by helping communication.

This point of view was in strong opposition to the practices of [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md), who applied high taxes and a strong authoritarian rule.
This divergence of perspective is one of the many differences between [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md) and [Jebus](/Characters/Jebus.md), and [Marihe](/Characters/Marihe.md) sort of took the middleground, trying to unify theirs stances, in a way that would satisfy both (although later events will see [Marihe](/Characters/Marihe.md) lean further and further away from [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md)).
