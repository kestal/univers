Jebus, son of [King Jahob]() and brother to [Marihe]() and [Jahob](), was one of the founders and ruler of [Kestalis]().

Even though he was still young during the first years of [Kestalis](), he is considered a founder du to his strong implication in its construction, mainly the urban planning.

During the years of ruling by his mother [Alianne](), Jebus helped her with his siblings, and at her death, the three of them shared the power.
Jebus was an advocate of non-invasive ruling and considered that a good chief of state should merely rule by helping communication.

This point of view was in strong opposition to the practices of [Jahob](the Second), who applied high taxes and a strong authoritarian rule.
This divergence of perspective is one of the many differences between [Jahob](the Second) and [Jebus](), and [Marihe]() sort of took the middleground, trying to unify theirs stances, in a way that would satisfy both (although later events will see [Marihe]() lean further and further away from [Jahob](the second)).
