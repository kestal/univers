Priest Salaman was a  member of the [Church Of The Fallen One](/Organisations/Church Of The Fallen One.md) and close advisor to [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md).
Initially an acquaintance of the queen, she presented him to [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), which allowed Salaman to get closer to the power.
At the death of the king, and the parting of his family, Salaman stayed in [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) for reasons unknown to them.

During the ruling of the Mafia-Cartel, he managed to make them leave the [Church](Church of the fallen one) pretty free, modulo some some high amounts of money.

At the return of [Jahob the Second](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md), Salaman managed to get close to the power, again, as a counseler.
