King Jahob ([-520](/Year/-520) until [-434](\Year/-434)) is the father of the founders of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis, Hillock District.md).
A prominent [mafia-cartel](/Organisations/Cartel-Mafia.md) took the opportunity of his death (by natural reasons) for a *coup* that overthrew his heirs and put the kingdom in a state of instability.
His family, having to flee, sailed west and traveled many months to reach a previously unknown to them continent, where they founded [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis, Hillock District.md).

## Reign
During his reign, King Jahob concentrated his efforts not on the expension of the kingdom, but rather on stabilizing it, and fighting the cartel-mafia and other inside enemies.

## Religion
Initially not a member of the [Church of the fallen one](/Organisations/Church Of The Fallen One.md), King Jahob converted after marrying [Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md). 
From then on, his faith only grew stronger, and the influence of the church on his rule too.
By the end of his rule, one of his closest advisor, [Priest Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md) was a high ranking member of the church.
