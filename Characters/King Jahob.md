King Jahob ([-520](/Year/-520) until [-434](\Year/-434)) is the father of the founders of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).
A prominent mafia-cartel took the opportunity of his death (by natural reasons) for a *coup* that overthrew his heirs and put the kingdom in a state of instability.
His family, having to flee, sailed west during many months to reach a previously unknown to them continent, where they founded [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalid.md).
