Kasamir ([-470](/Year/-470.md) until [-399](/Year/-399.md)) was one of the lords of the [Southern Islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md).

He is one of the main figures in the economical development of the [islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md), due to his involvement in trade with [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) at first, but more importantly with  [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).

Kasamir was a rather close friend to [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) and their bond was the basis of a solid trading relation between their two states.
At the death of [Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), Kasamir, of loyal temperament, stopped the trading with [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) but continued it with the family of the deceased king; which grew very rapidly due to the needs of an expanding [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).
