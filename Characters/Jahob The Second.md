Jahob The Second, son of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) is one of the leading parties in the founding of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).
After the death of his father and the coup, he fled by boat with his family and a small contingent of trusted members of their house, and helped found [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).
In [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md), he first shared the power with his siblings ([Jebus](/Characters/Jebus.md) and [Marihe](/Characters/Marihe.md)) after their mother died.
In a spirit of revenge, he later led an army to [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) to try and reconquer what had been taken by the [Mafia-Cartel]().
He managed to get [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) back, but not the rest of his father's kingdom, which stayed under the influence of the [Mafia-Cartel]().
He then settled in [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) in the perspective of rallying people and strengthening his position to eventually conquer the rest of the kingdom.
It is at that time that [Priest Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md), who had stayed in [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) during and after the coup, reached to [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md).

The departure of [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md) from [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md), against his siblings' counsels, signed his sundering from the rest of the family.
At first, the relation between the newly compliant [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) and [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md) were somewhat friendly, but it clearly degraded, even before the deaths of [Jebus](/Characters/Jebus.md) and [Marihe](/Characters/Marihe.md), until it reached a point of cold hostility when their children inherited the reign of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).

[Jahob the 2nd](), now isolated from his kin and counseled by [Priest Salaman](/Characters/Priest Salaman.md), began directing the whole city in an effort of war.
The resource-intensive process cost the city dearly, and [Jahob](/Characters/Jahob The Second.md) sent many ships to [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md) to try and get support, but to no avail.
