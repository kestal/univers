Jahob The Second, son of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md) is one of the leading parties in the founding of [Kestalis](/Geography/Kestalis.md).
After the death of his father and the coup, he fled by boat with his family and a small contingent of trusted members of their house, and helped found [Kestalis]().
In [Kestalis](), he first shared the power with his siblings ([Jebus]() and [Marihe]()) after their mother died.
In a spirit of revenge, he later led an army to [Littlefall]() to try and reconquer what had been taken by the [Mafia-Cartel]().
He managed to get [Littlefall]() back, but not the rest of his father's kingdom, which stayed under the influence of the [Mafia-Cartel]().
He then settled in [Littlefall]() in the perspective of rallying people and strengthening his position to eventually conquer the rest of the kingdom.
It is at that time that [Priest Salaman](), who had stayed in [Littlefall]() during and after the coup, reached to [Jahob]().
