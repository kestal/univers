Queen Alianne (-518 until -435) is the mother of the founders of [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md).
Spouse of [King Jahob](/characters/King Jahob.md) she had to leave her realm, eventhough she had acquaintances, 
some would say kinship, in the mafia-cartel that took over the power. 
When established in [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md), she decided not to speak anymore.
