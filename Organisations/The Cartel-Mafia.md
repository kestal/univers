The cartel-mafia that took the power at the death of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md).
Primarily based in the kingdom capital, [Littlefall](/Geography/Littlefall.md), the cartel-mafia was a loose organisation, with coming and going "members" of all sorts of background.

The cartel-mafia found its birth, during a period little state presence, when an informal cartel of bankers and money lenders, along with the mafia of [Littlefall](/Geography/Littlefall.md) noticed that they could ally the money of the former with the force of the latter to achieve the goals of both.
