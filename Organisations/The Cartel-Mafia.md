The cartel-mafia that took the power at the death of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md).
Primarily based in the kingdom capital, [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), the cartel-mafia was a loose organisation, with coming and going "members" of all sorts of background.

The cartel-mafia found its birth, during a period little state presence, when an informal cartel of bankers and money lenders, along with the mafia of [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) noticed that they could unite and ally the money of the former with the force of the latter to achieve the goals of both. 

During [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md)'s reign, many measures were taken in an effort to try and reduce the power of the cartel-mafia.
This resulted to them getting notably weaker than before.
At the death of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), the cartel-mafia took advantage of the event and managed to commit a *coup d'Ã©tat*, and get the power for themselves.

This led the royal family to flee to the West, and allowed them to reign over the kingdom with no disturbance.
Unfortunately for them, power didn't suit them much, and the [City of Littlefall]() lost much of its original richness under their reign; mainly because of their short-term management.
Many of the traders and workers exhiled to lesser towns of the kingdom, and richness got spread more evenly than before.

Seeing that, the leading members of the Cartel-Mafia decided to follow the money and divided the country so that each member would have a profitable part of the kingdom (at first, the center was [Littlefall](), and was conjointly ruled by all the members of the Cartel-Mafia; with the loss of its richness, some members began to think that they would do better to fully manage their part, which led to the partitionning).

At [Jahob the Second]()'s arrival, [Littlefall]() was easy to conquer with his armed forces, but the rest of the kingdom not so much. 
At that time, the Cartel-Mafia had only a small, underground influence on [Littlefall](), while still dominating much of the rest of the kingdom.
