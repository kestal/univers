The cartel-mafia that took the power at the death of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md).
Primarily based in the kingdom capital, [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md), the cartel-mafia was a loose organisation, with coming and going "members" of all sorts of background.

The cartel-mafia found its birth, during a period little state presence, when an informal cartel of bankers and money lenders, along with the mafia of [Littlefall](/Geography/City of Littlefall.md) noticed that they could unite and ally the money of the former with the force of the latter to achieve the goals of both. 

During [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md)'s reign, many measures were taken in an effort to try and reduce the power of the cartel-mafia.
This resulted to them getting notably weaker than before.
At the death of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), the cartel-mafia took advantage of the event to commit a coup d'Ã©tat, and get the power for themselves.
