The city of Littlefall was the capital of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md)'s kingdom.
It got its name from a relatively small waterfall, which became the center and symbol of the city.

After [King Jahob]()'s death, and the coup of the [Mafia-Cartel](), the city stayed under their rule for many years, effectively becoming a Mafia-Cartel-City.
During this time, the quality of life rapidly degraded and the city lost much of its former strength.
The most important members of the Mafia-Cartel-*cum*-government then saw less interest in the city and began partitionning the rest of the Kingdom, each owning some territory; while the city still stayed under their common influence.

At [Jahob the Second]()'s return, while still fighting for the city, the [Mafia-Cartel]() didn't use much force and retreated to the land, which allowed [Jahob]() to take it.
