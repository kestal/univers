Kestalis is a portuary city founded on the year [-433](/Year/-433) by the exiled royal family (heirs, wife) of the kingdom of [King Jahob](/Characters/King Jahob.md), on the east cost of [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md).
It rose to prominence as an important exchange port for the commerce of spice and other goods, with cities of [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md) and the [Southern Islands](/Geography/Southern Islands.md).

At the arrival of the newly exiled [Queen Alianne](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md), her children and a small part of her entourage and servants, what would then become Kestalis was a non-inhabited strip of land bordering a creek.
Although the exact spot was empty, it had many neighbouring fishing villages and habitations.

When they decided to settle there and found a city, the richness they had taken with them on their travel helped pay for local labor.
During the first years of the city, the main force for its development was the commerce of goods originating from [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md) with locals of the area, that didn't even know of its existence, before the arrival of the [Queen](/Characters/Queen Alianne.md) and her entourage.
