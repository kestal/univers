Islands to the south and between [Continent I](/Geography/Continent I.md) and [Continent II](/Geography/Continent II.md).

The climate is rather cold, but still temperate.

The fidelity of the traders of the islands is one of the main reasons [Kestalis](/Geography/City of Kestalis.md) came to be, and grew as rapidly as it did.

## Geography

## Politics

The Southern Islands are divided into small semi independent kingdoms and states, whose borders often change due to association of neighbooring states or division, and change of rulers.
Even though the political borders are quite fluid, a relative peace still dominates the islands.


## Society

Due to their relative isolation from the other continents but closeness one from each other, the southern islands have a relatively uniform culture; the political borders aren't cultural ones.



## Religion

Originally of strong pagan beliefs, the arrival of members of the [Church of the fallen One]() in the Southern Islands started a slow process of integration of this new religion.
The actual religion can now be characterised as a syncretization of the principles of the [Charch of the fallen One]() in the local belief system, varying in degree from island to island.


### Myths

The Southern Islands originally had a small [elvish]() population, spread evenly on the islands.
In the early years of the human occupation of the islands, the [elves]() slowly decreased in number until they finally vanished almost completely, only to remain on the southernmost one, on which the humans haven't established any settlement.
The [elves]() are almost mythical beings for the islanders, and they are left alone, considered mainly with fear.
The pagan folklore considers them to be akin to the shepherds of the islands, choosen by the gods.

The islanders believe to be the chosen people of the god (or rather, godly representation) of the sea.
During the early years of humanity, the gods shared their rule over the humans, but the sea-god being an jealous one, he decided that sharing didn't suit his wants, and stole part of the humans and hid them on a remote location, the southern islands.
This saddended Æther, and that is why the islands are very windy.
In this folklore, the elves have been created by the gods with the goal of taking care of the earth, and thus, wherever earth is, there are elves; this plays a role, at least mythologically, in the fear that the humans have towards elves.

In the islands's mythology, the world was first only Æther, and  Æther felt alone, and decided to share its existence and created the sea.
But the water cannot lie on nothing, and thus the earth was created for water to lie on, and its existence with the Sea and Æther. 
This is how the sea was borne, and the land from which it stands.

Life is the fourth main divinity of the southern island's pantheon.
Before Life, the world was still, and nothing changed.
Life is what made the world more than simply the sum of its original three components, and what allowed diversity and change to appear and stay.

Grass and the animals that live by it are the most beloved childs of Life, and due to their heavy sheep consumption, the islanders are very devoted to both.

#### 

The Islanders also believe that due to the Sea's instable personality, a time will come when it will become bored of them and, in a moment of rage, engulf them all in an apocalyptic tempest.

#### Dwarves

The mythology of the southern islands doesn't include [dwarves](), because they are not a local species.
